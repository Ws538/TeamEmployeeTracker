# TeamEmployeeTracker

## Description

TeamEmployeeTracker is a terminal based query system in which allows the user to create a database for their teams and to view and update their roles at any given time. This solves the issue of constantly having to update paperwork for employee files and to have a seemless, simplified way to store data. Whilst making this EmployeeTracker, I have learnt to create mysql databases, JOINING , creating queries and integrating into a dynamic inquirer app.

## Installation

To install, 
- Fork the repo 
- Change the mysql password in server.js to your local mysql password
- Open server.js terminal and run "npm i" to install dependencies
- Open schema.sql terminal and run "source schema.sql" , then run "source seeds.sql"


## Usage

To start the application, open server.js terminal again and run "node server.js",
then fill out the inquirer prompts.
